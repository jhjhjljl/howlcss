		<h1>Howl.css — A loyal companion for your HTML</h1>
		<p>Howl is a loyal, classless CSS framework that follows your HTML wherever it goes. Named after my Shih Tzu, it's designed to bark at the complexity of modern web dev—giving you a beautiful, semantic site using nothing but the tags you already know.</p>
		<p>Howl leaves no tag behind. While other frameworks only style the basics, Howl provides 100% coverage for every element in the <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements">MDN reference</a>. If it's valid HTML, it's already styled and ready to go.</p>
		<p>Howl is perfect for prototyping and honing your semantic HTML skills. However, please avoid using it in production, as classless CSS has inherent scaling limitations. It’s a great way to rediscover the power of native HTML elements instead of relying on <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> containers for everything.</p>

			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;article&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples include a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a product card, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;aside&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main content. Asides are frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;footer&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Represents a footer for its nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root element. A <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data, or links to related documents.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;header&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h4&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h5&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Represent six levels of section headings. <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> is the highest section level and <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> is the lowest.</p>
				<h1>The Alpha Wolf (H1)</h1>
				<p>This is the primary heading for the page or a major section.</p>
				<h2>The Pack Leader (H2)</h2>
				<p>Used for major sub-sections of your content.</p>
				<h3>The Beta Member (H3)</h3>
				<p>Perfect for sub-topics within an H2 section.</p>
				<h4>The Scout (H4)</h4>
				<p>Grouping related items or smaller sub-points.</p>
				<h5>The Prowler (H5)</h5>
				<p>Often used for sidebar headers or small utility headings.</p>
				<h6>The Omega (H6)</h6>
				<p>The smallest level of heading, used for very specific fine-print sections.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;hgroup&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Represents a heading grouped with any secondary content, such as subheadings, an alternative title, or a tagline.</p>
				<hgroup>
					<h1>The Howl Project</h1>
					<p>A minimalist design system for the modern web</p>
				</hgroup>
				<p>This is a standard paragraph. In a classless system, the goal is to let the natural flow of the document dictate the spacing. Because the max-width is limited, the line length remains comfortable for the eyes.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;main&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Represents the dominant content of the body of a document. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central functionality of an application.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;nav&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide navigation links, either within the current document or to other documents. Common examples of navigation sections are menus, tables of contents, and indexes.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;section&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Represents a generic standalone section of a document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it. Sections should always have a heading, with very few exceptions.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;search&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Represents a part that contains a set of form controls or other content related to performing a search or filtering operation.</p>
			</article>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2 id="text-content">Text content</h2>
			<p>Use HTML text content elements to organize blocks or sections of content placed between the opening <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> and closing <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tags. Important for accessibility and SEO, these elements identify the purpose or structure of that content.</p>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation. A URL for the source of the quotation may be given using the <code>cite</code> attribute, while a text representation of the source can be given using the <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> element.</p>
				<blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">For 50 years, WWF has been protecting the future of nature. The world's leading conservation organization, WWF works in 100 countries and is supported by 1.2 million members in the United States and close to 5 million globally.</blockquote>

				<h3><code>&lt;div&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>The generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way using CSS (e.g., styling is directly applied to it, or some kind of layout model like <code>flexbox</code> is applied to its parent element).</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;dl&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Represents a description list. The element encloses a list of groups of terms (specified using the <code>&lt;dt&gt;</code> element) and descriptions (provided by <code>&lt;dd&gt;</code> elements).

			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;p&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.</p>
				<p>Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Esse vel eos facilis iusto voluptatem, expedita sint quae beatae temporibus aliquid delectus ipsam dolor repellendus repudiandae eius commodi quo corporis accusamus?</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;pre&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Represents preformatted text which is to be presented exactly as written in the HTML file. The text is typically rendered using a non-proportional, or <code>monospaced</code> font. Whitespace inside this element is displayed as written.</p>

			<h2 id="inline-text-semantics">Inline text semantics</h2>
			<p>Use the HTML inline text semantic to define the meaning, structure, or style of a word, line, or any arbitrary piece of text.</p>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;a&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Together with its <code>href</code> attribute, creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations within the current page, or anything else a URL can address.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Represents an abbreviation or acronym.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;b&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface. However, you should not use <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> for styling text or granting importance. If you wish to create boldface text, you should use the CSS <code>font-weight</code> property. If you wish to indicate an element is of special importance, you should use the <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> element.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;bdi&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Tells the browser's bidirectional algorithm to treat the text it contains in isolation from its surrounding text. It's particularly useful when a website dynamically inserts some text and doesn't know the directionality of the text being inserted.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;bdo&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Overrides the current directionality of text, so that the text within is rendered in a different direction.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;br&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Produces a line break in text (carriage-return). It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is significant.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;cite&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Used to mark up the title of a creative work. The reference may be in an abbreviated form according to context-appropriate conventions related to citation metadata.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;code&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Displays its contents styled in a fashion intended to indicate that the text is a short fragment of computer code. By default, the content text is displayed using the user agent's default monospace font.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;data&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Links a given piece of content with a machine-readable translation. If the content is time- or date-related, the <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> element must be used.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;dfn&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Used to indicate the term being defined within the context of a definition phrase or sentence. The ancestor <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element, the <code>&lt;dt&gt;</code>/<code>&lt;dd&gt;</code> pairing, or the nearest section ancestor of the <code>&lt;dfn&gt;</code> element, is considered to be the definition of the term.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;em&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Marks text that has stress emphasis. The <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> element can be nested, with each nesting level indicating a greater degree of emphasis.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;i&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms, and taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> naming of this element.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Represents a span of inline text denoting textual user input from a keyboard, voice input, or any other text entry device. By convention, the user agent defaults to rendering the contents of a <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code> element using its default monospace font, although this is not mandated by the HTML standard.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;mark&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Represents text which is marked or highlighted for reference or notation purposes due to the marked passage's relevance in the enclosing context.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;q&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Indicates that the enclosed text is a short inline quotation. Most modern browsers implement this by surrounding the text in quotation marks. This element is intended for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks; for long quotations use the <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> element.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;rp&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Used to provide fall-back parentheses for browsers that do not support the display of ruby annotations using the <code>&lt;ruby&gt;</code> element. One <code>&lt;rp&gt;</code> element should enclose each of the opening and closing parentheses that wrap the <code>&lt;rt&gt;</code> element that contains the annotation's text.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;rt&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Specifies the ruby text component of a ruby annotation, which is used to provide pronunciation, translation, or transliteration information for East Asian typography. The <code>&lt;rt&gt;</code> element must always be contained within a <code>&lt;ruby&gt;</code> element.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;ruby&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Represents small annotations that are rendered above, below, or next to base text, usually used for showing the pronunciation of East Asian characters. It can also be used for annotating other kinds of text, but this usage is less common.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;s&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Renders text with a strikethrough, or a line through it. Use the <code>&lt;s&gt;</code> element to represent things that are no longer relevant or no longer accurate. However, <code>&lt;s&gt;</code> is not appropriate when indicating document edits; for that, use the <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;ins&gt;</code> elements, as appropriate.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;samp&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Used to enclose inline text which represents sample (or quoted) output from a computer program. Its contents are typically rendered using the browser's default monospaced font (such as <code>Courier</code> or Lucida Console).</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;small&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Represents side-comments and small print, like copyright and legal text, independent of its styled presentation. By default, it renders text within it one font size smaller, such as from <code>small</code> to <code>x-small</code>.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;span&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>A generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the <code>class</code> or <code>id</code> attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as <code>lang</code>. It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate. <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> is very much like a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element, but <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is a block-level element whereas a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> is an inline-level element.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;strong&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Indicates that its contents have strong importance, seriousness, or urgency. Browsers typically render the contents in bold type.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;sub&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Specifies inline text which should be displayed as subscript for solely typographical reasons. Subscripts are typically rendered with a lowered baseline using smaller text.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;sup&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Specifies inline text which is to be displayed as superscript for solely typographical reasons. Superscripts are usually rendered with a raised baseline using smaller text.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;time&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Represents a specific period in time. It may include the <code>datetime</code> attribute to translate dates into machine-readable format, allowing for better search engine results or custom features such as reminders.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;u&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation. This is rendered by default as a single solid underline but may be altered using CSS.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;var&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Represents the name of a variable in a mathematical expression or a programming context. It's typically presented using an italicized version of the current typeface, although that behavior is browser-dependent.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;wbr&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Represents a word break opportunity—a position within text where the browser may optionally break a line, though its line-breaking rules would not otherwise create a break at that location.</p>
			</article>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2 id="image-and-multimedia">Image and multimedia</h2>
			<p>HTML supports various multimedia resources such as images, audio, and video.</p>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;area&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Defines an area inside an image map that has predefined clickable areas. An image map allows geometric areas on an image to be associated with hyperlink.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;audio&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Used to embed sound content in documents. It may contain one or more audio sources, represented using the <code>src</code> attribute or the <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> element: the browser will choose the most suitable one. It can also be the destination for streamed media, using a <code>MediaStream</code>.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;img&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Embeds an image into the document.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;map&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Used with <code>&lt;area&gt;</code> elements to define an image map (a clickable link area).</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;track&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Used as a child of the media elements, <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>. It lets you specify timed text tracks (or time-based data), for example to automatically handle subtitles. The tracks are formatted in WebVTT format (<code>.vtt</code> files)—Web Video Text Tracks.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;video&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Embeds a media player which supports video playback into the document. You can also use <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> for audio content, but the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element may provide a more appropriate user experience.</p>
			</article>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2 id="embedded-content">Embedded content</h2>
			<p>In addition to regular multimedia content, HTML can include a variety of other content, even if it's not always easy to interact with.</p>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;embed&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Embeds external content at the specified point in the document. This content is provided by an external application or other source of interactive content such as a browser plug-in.</p>

			</article>
			<article>
				<h3><code>&lt;source&gt;</code></h3>
				<p>Specifies multiple media resources for the <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code>, the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element, or the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element. It is a void element, meaning that it has no content and does not have a closing tag. It is commonly used to offer the same media content in multiple file formats in order to provide compatibility with a broad range of browsers given their differing support for image file formats and media file formats.</p>
