		<h1>Howl.css — A loyal companion for your HTML</h1>
		<p>Howl is a loyal, classless CSS framework that follows your HTML wherever it goes. Named after my Shih Tzu, it's designed to bark at the complexity of modern web dev—giving you a beautiful, semantic site using nothing but the tags you already know.</p>
		<p>Howl leaves no tag behind. While other frameworks only style the basics, Howl provides 100% coverage for every element in the <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements">MDN reference</a>. If it's valid HTML, it's already styled and ready to go.</p>

			<h2>Content sectioning</h2>
			<p>Content sectioning elements allow you to organize the document content into logical pieces. Use the sectioning elements to create a broad outline for your page content, including header and footer navigation, and heading elements to identify sections of content.</p>
			<article>
				<h3>&lt;address&gt;</h3>
				<p>Indicates that the enclosed HTML provides contact information for a person or people, or for an organization.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3>&lt;article&gt;</h3>
				<p>Represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples include a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a product card, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3>&lt;aside&gt;</h3>
				<p>Represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main content. Asides are frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3>&lt;footer&gt;</h3>
				<p>Represents a footer for its nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root element. A &lt;footer&gt; typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data, or links to related documents.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3>&lt;header&gt;</h3>
				<p>Represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3>&lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;, &lt;h4&gt;, &lt;h5&gt;, &lt;h6&gt;</h3>
				<p>Represent six levels of section headings. &lt;h1&gt; is the highest section level and &lt;h6&gt; is the lowest.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3>&lt;hgroup&gt;</h3>
				<p>Represents a heading grouped with any secondary content, such as subheadings, an alternative title, or a tagline.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3>&lt;main&gt;</h3>
				<p>Represents the dominant content of the body of a document. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central functionality of an application.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3>&lt;nav&gt;</h3>
				<p>Represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide navigation links, either within the current document or to other documents. Common examples of navigation sections are menus, tables of contents, and indexes.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3>&lt;section&gt;</h3>
				<p>Represents a generic standalone section of a document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it. Sections should always have a heading, with very few exceptions.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3>&lt;search&gt;</h3>
				<p>Represents a part that contains a set of form controls or other content related to performing a search or filtering operation.</p>
			</article>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Text content</h2>
			<p>Use HTML text content elements to organize blocks or sections of content placed between the opening &lt;body&gt; and closing &lt;/body&gt; tags. Important for accessibility and SEO, these elements identify the purpose or structure of that content.</p>
			<article>
				<h3>&lt;blockquote&gt;</h3>
				<p>Indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation. A URL for the source of the quotation may be given using the cite attribute, while a text representation of the source can be given using the &lt;cite&gt; element.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3>&lt;dd&gt;</h3>
				<p>Provides the description, definition, or value for the preceding term (&lt;dt&gt;) in a description list (&lt;dl&gt;).</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3>&lt;div&gt;</h3>
				<p>The generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way using CSS (e.g., styling is directly applied to it, or some kind of layout model like flexbox is applied to its parent element).</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3>&lt;dl&gt;</h3>
				<p>Represents a description list. The element encloses a list of groups of terms (specified using the &lt;dt&gt; element) and descriptions (provided by &lt;dd&gt; elements). Common uses for this element are to implement a glossary or to display metadata (a list of key-value pairs).</p>
